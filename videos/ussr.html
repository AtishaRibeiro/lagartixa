<p class="video-description">I discovered Bald's channel in 2019. His videos gave me insight into a world that was barely known to me at the time, kickstarted my love for the russian language, and in turn for russian music. For the longest time I wanted to map out all the places he'd been to, and finally decided to go for it. In total 2 months was spent on just creating the visuals (mainly the 3D globe) and another 2 months going through his videos and finding all locations he went to. Some locations were easy, others took some real geoguessr detective work.</p>

<p class="video-notes">Originally uploaded on 2025-03-30 but it turned out I forgot to hightlight Latvia as part of the USSR in the intro, so I fixed it and reuploaded.</p>
