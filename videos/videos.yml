  description-short: A dreamy lyric video for my favourite song on the WWAOE album.
  description: I've been listening non-stop to the WWAOE album from Real Lies, and this specific song just stuck out; A continuous stream of words that is just begging for a lyric video. This took only 4 evenings to make, a welcome change from the 4 months the last video took.

- name: Bald and Bankrupt in the former USSR 
  name-link: ussr
  description-short: A compilation of all the places the youtuber Bald and Bankrupt visited in the former USSR.
  description: I discovered Bald's channel in 2019. His videos gave me insight into a world that was barely known to me at the time, kickstarted my love for the russian language, and in turn for russian music. For the longest time I wanted to map out all the places he'd been to, and finally decided to go for it. In total 2 months was spent on just creating the visuals (mainly the 3D globe) and another 2 months going through his videos and finding all locations he went to. Some locations were easy, others took some real geoguessr detective work.

    Dedicated to the people, cultures and languages of the former Soviet Union.

    Some clarfications.
    * All country/region borders are the way they are because I use Natural Earth's data, which uses *de facto* boundaries.
    * I chose to stick to 1 language per country for place names for practical reasons. I'm aware that Russian is more widely spoken in Belarus, but Google Maps uses Belarusian which is why I also use it. There are 2 exceptions:
     1. Pobeda in Georgia. AFAIK it has no Georgian name since the town was created in the USSR.
     2. Karki/Tigranashen. I didn't want to make it seem like I was picking a side, so I included both.
    * I removed duplicate locations within a single video, to reduce video length.
    * I'm aware Bald visited Tajikistan in a later video, but for me the USSR story ended with the video where he got kicked out of Russia.
    * I left out a few videos:
    1. Summary videos of Tuva and Belarus.
    2. Intro video for Georgia
    3. "Stranded On A Russian Highway!" which is actually about going to Bolivia
    4. Videos that were deleted by Bald
    5. Videos from the Daily Bald channel

    Music by the one and only Kino.

  notes: Originally uploaded on 2025-03-30 but it turned out I forgot to hightlight Latvia as part of the USSR in the intro, so I fixed it and reuploaded.

  description-short: A visualiser for Molchat Doma's Prognoz. Including lyrics. 
  description: My first ever music visualiser, driven by a long-standing obsession with visually syncing things to sound. I'm no Blender artist, but the Hotel Panorama is simple enough in style to give it a shot.
