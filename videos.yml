- name: Bald and Bankrupt in the former USSR 
  description: A compilation of all the places the youtuber Bald and Bankrupt visited in the former USSR.
  youtube-description: |
    Dedicated to the people, cultures and languages of the former Soviet Union.

    Some clarfications.
    * All country/region borders are the way they are because I use Natural Earth's data, which uses *de facto* boundaries.
    * I chose to stick to 1 language per country for place names for practical reasons. I'm aware that Russian is more widely spoken in Belarus, but Google Maps uses Belarusian which is why I also use it. There are 2 exceptions:
     1. Pobeda in Georgia. AFAIK it has no Georgian name since the town was created in the USSR.
     2. Karki/Tigranashen. I didn't want to make it seem like I was picking a side, so I included both.
    * I removed duplicate locations within a single video, to reduce video length.
    * I'm aware Bald visited Tajikistan in a later video, but for me the USSR story ended with the video where he got kicked out of Russia.
    * I left out a few videos:
    1. Summary videos of Tuva and Belarus.
    2. Intro video for Georgia
    3. "Stranded On A Russian Highway!" which is actually about going to Bolivia
    4. Videos that were deleted by Bald
    5. Videos from the Daily Bald channel

    Music by the one and only Kino.

  notes: Originally uploaded on 2025-03-30 but it turned out I forgot to hightlight Latvia as part of the USSR in the intro, so I fixed it and reuploaded.
